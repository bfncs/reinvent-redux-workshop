# Workshop: Reinvent redux

[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) is widely used as state container for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). While Redux is essentially easy to use, it needs a good initial understanding to be productive with it.

To get a better grasp this workshops leads through reimplementing the core functionality of Redux in the most simple way, leaving out most of error handling and performance optimizations. With this proper understanding you will find it more easy to solve issues with React/Redux. :muscle:
