# Workshop: Reinvent redux

[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) is widely used as state container for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). While Redux is essentially easy to use, it needs a good initial understanding to be productive with it.

To get a better grasp this workshops leads through reimplementing the core functionality of Redux in the most simple way, leaving out most of error handling and performance optimizations. With this proper understanding you will find it more easy to solve issues with React/Redux. :muscle:

**Note:** The code presented here is missing important checks and optimizations to make it easier to understand the underlying concepts. To not use any of this in production.

# Usage

Checkout this repository and install all the dependencies by running `npm install`. Use `npm start` to fire up a local development server.

Each single commit after `26d89f2` implements one aspect of `redux` or `react-redux`. Check out the commits you are interested in and look at the diffs to see what has to be done.
